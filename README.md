# WCAG_Audit_Examples
This is a repository that will hopefully be filled with examples of situation that either pass or fail specific WCAG SC. It will also house examples about which there is no clear consensus wether or not they pass or fail WCAG. It can house many forms of examples, not just HTML examples. For example, currently WCAG is also used to see if mobile apps comply to WCAG. This repository could house screenshots or even descriptions of situations that would either pass or fail WCAG.

# current status of this repository
At the time of writing (10 August 2021) this repository holds 0 examples and is just a draft. It will likely be filled with errors and dumb ideas. Please feel free to laugh at it or give us feedback so we can improve it.

# WCAG
WCAG stands for Web Contect Accessibilty Guidlines and is a set of guidelines that can be followed to make sure your web content is accessible for all users. For more information see https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/

# The problem
WCAG tries to both be very objective and technology agnostic in it's wording. This leads to many situations where it is unclear whether or not a certain situation should pass or fail WCAG, even to senior professional auditors.

# One of the solutions
One way to try and solve this issue is simply to discuss the situation in question amonst auditors and to document the conclusion of the discussion (and maybe the arguments used to reach this conclusion). This already happens within many organisations that perform audits, but there is not yet a platform to discuss and document these situations on an international scale. This repository tries to be that platform.

# Other solutions
This repository isn't the only attempt to solve this issue. I feel like the amazing work at the act-rules repository should be mentioned for example. 

# The target audience of this repository
The target audience of this repository is people that perform WCAG audits and want their audits to be consistent with other organisations performing WCAG audits around the globe. If this repository grows large enough it will probably also be used by developers to see if their work is likely to pass WCAG audits. However this repository will, by it's very nature, be filled with:
* examples that barely pass WCAG,
* examples that pass this WCAG SC but don't pass all WCAG SC,
* examples that pass WCAG on a technicallity but aren't actually accessible,
* examples that currently pass WCAG but could, after 1 or 2 discussions, or a release of an update of WCAG, suddenly no longer pass WCAG. 

So this repository is not meant to check whether your work is accessible or not and should not be used as best practices.
